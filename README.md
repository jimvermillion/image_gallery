##Jim Vermillion - Individual Code Test

This should be an individual assessment of your ability to write full stack Javascript web applications. Do not work with other students on this project as we want to see your individual ability to write code. 

For this project you're going to make an image gallery. Users of the application should be able to submit a link to an image and a description of the image. Important note: you do not have to allow them to submit an actual image, just a link to one. This link/caption should be saved on a sever and the page should retrieve those image links and render them on a page, it can be the same page that allows users to submit new links. Authentication is not required but tests are. Use whatever tools you want to accomplish the task, this should take you 1-2 hours to complete.
